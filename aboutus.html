                <h4 class="text-start border-bottom"> Challenges that I faced on this webpage </h4>
                <p class="text-start">At first, I found everything overwhelming. I had built websites before, but just for fun and simple stuff and had never published any. During the lecture, Bootstrap was used, but only to change the colors of a table.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">My first step was to go to Bootstrap's documentation, and I was amazed at how pretty and cool everything was. I wanted everything on my page xD! I ran into troubles with the first element that I implemented, the carousel. I spent some time debugging just to figure out I was using the link for an older version of Bootstrap!</p>

                    <p class="text-start">Another ally was the JS/CSS/HTML documentation. Understanding how each HTML element was interpreted for the DOM really put stuff into place. Of course, I cannot forget DEVTOOLS. I spent a lot of time on trivial errors, and DevTools helped me debug those a lot.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">Another challenge that I faced was the lack of ideas for a theme. CS50 makes a lot of references to cats and sitcoms, so I decided that instead of finding the perfect layout or subject, to just do it so I can go on with the course.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">When it comes to the experience of taking CS50, as someone that lives in Brazil, I would never be able to take this course if it wasn't online. Thank you a lot for that. The lectures are well-structured and fun, and the additional sections implemented are amazing. CS50 helped me realize that nothing is too hard and that I should enjoy the learning process and have fun with it. Allow yourself to make mistakes!</p>

                    <p class="text-start">I am going to keep on learning from now on, and when I look back at this webpage, I will see how much I have improved. Hope you guys enjoy it!</p>
